# EchoServerClient
This is an example of a simple echo client and server using TCP sockets. The server was written in C and deployed on a virtual 
machine running Linux. 
The client was written for Android in Java and deployed on a mobile device. The client specifies the IP address of the server and 
the port is hardcoded for 27015. The client then enters a message which the server simply returns back to the client.
